## User Stories and Scenarios
### Pins
- As a user, I want to create a "pin" with a URL, title, description and image because I want to store my most useful study resources in a central location.
- As a user, I should be able to edit/delete the pins that I have created because I own those pins.
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to edit/delete other user pins, because I don't own those pins.
- As a user, I want to be able to like/save, comment, and rate pins because I want to engage with other users.
- As a user, I want to be able to like/save pins because I want to collect new & useful resources that other users have added.
- As a user, I want to be able to rate pins because I want to be able to visually understand which resources have been most useful to me.

### Search Feature
- As a user, I want to be able to filter pins by category, rating, or search terms because I want to find good resources relevant to me.
- As a user, I want the search bar to visually change after I have clicked it because I want to easily understand where my cursor is located/which part of the page I am interacting with.

### User Profiles
- As a user, I want to see all of the pins I've created (in addition to pins that I’ve liked) in one central location (my profile) because I want to see the resources that I find most useful.
- As a user, I want to be able to update my profile username, password, or description because I want to let other users know what I’m currently interested in.
- As a user, I shouldn’t be able to edit another user’s profile, because I don’t own that account.

### Logged In vs. Logged Out
- As a logged out user, I should only be able see the login/register pages because I want to be part of a closed network that requires users to log in.
- As a logged in user, I should be redirected to the main page with _all_ user pins (including my own) after logging in because I am most interested in the core feature of this application (a compilation of study resources).
- As a logged in user, I should be able to see my username in the nav bar because I want to be able to quickly and easily confirm that I am logged in to my account.
- Given that I am not logged in, when I click on a pin I can only view it.
- Given that I am logged in or logged out, when I click on the search bar I can type a filter word and at the same time a drop down of - categories will appear that I can choose from.
